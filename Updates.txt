    + Nuked OPL3 sound core
    + S98 support
    * some bugfixes to existing sound cores

    + more accurate playback of YM2203/YM2608 FM when the song changes the clock mid-song (e.g. City Connection)
    ! reduced default GameBoy DMG volume - it was overpowering everything else before
    - removed some YM2612 hacks, so some YM2612 VGMs from Project2612 may not start as cleanly as with VGMPlay/in_vgm 0.40.x
    - removed ES5505/5506 emulation (the old implementation was very hackish)
    ! "NukedType" option has values 0 and 3 (filtered/unfiltered YM2612) swapped
- removed CMF support
- removed support for playback on real OPL3 hardware
+ You can drop multiple files on VGMPlay now. A mix of VGMs and m3u playlists works as well.

+ You can use the keys 0..9 to quickly jump to song position 0%..90%.
+ added player options: SetTerminalTitle, FadePause, ShowChipCore, AudioDriver

+ added chip option "PanMask", which allows for per-channel panning (only supported by few sound cores currently)
! removed RF5C164 option section, it is controlled by the RF5C68 section now
! split C219 settings from C140, giving the C219 a new section
+ When a file failed to open, you can use playlist control keys. (Previously it would just go to the next file.)
- removed player options "EmulatePause" and "ShowStreamCmds" (may come back later)
* VGMPlay should be thread-safe now, so there should be no random warnings about invalid commands when seeking anymore.
